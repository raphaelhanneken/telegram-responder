# Telegram Responder

A small script that responds to private chat messages, containing the word "trump", with a random quote from [whatdoestrumpthink.com](https://whatdoestrumpthink.com).

The script can be run inside a Docker container or started locally as launchd service, at login.

To run the script locally you will need python 3.9 and the following packages:

* requests
* python-dotenv
* telethon
